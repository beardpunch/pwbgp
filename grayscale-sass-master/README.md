I do not take credit, for the designing of this template!

The original version can be found at [Start Bootstrap](http://startbootstrap.com/) - [Grayscale](http://startbootstrap.com/template-overviews/grayscale/)

[Grayscale](http://startbootstrap.com/template-overviews/grayscale/) is a multipurpose, one page HTML theme for [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/) created by [Start Bootstrap](http://startbootstrap.com/). This template features various content sections and a Google Maps section with a custom map marker.

## What's different?

This version of the template uses Compass and SASS instead of LESS, and builds on the bower dependency manager.
